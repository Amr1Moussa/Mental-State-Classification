# Slide 1: Introduction to EEG Classification Pipeline
- Objective: Classify mental states (e.g., relaxed, neutral, stressed) using EEG signals
- Approach: Neural network with preprocessing and feature extraction
- Key components:
  - Data preprocessing and dimensionality reduction
  - Neural network with sigmoid activation
  - Training with cross-entropy loss and early stopping

# Slide 2: Data Preprocessing Pipeline
- Raw EEG data: 1000 features per sample
- Feature extraction:
  - Statistical features (mean, variance, skewness)
  - Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for frequency domain
- Why DCT?
  - Captures low-frequency patterns (important for EEG)
  - Discards high-frequency noise
- Standardization:
  - Zero mean, unit variance per feature
  - Prevents large-scale features from dominating
  - Speeds up neural network convergence

# Slide 3: Dimensionality Reduction
- Goal: Keep most important features
- Methods:
  - Statistical feature extraction (mean, variance, skewness)
  - DCT to focus on low-frequency components
- Benefits:
  - Reduces computational complexity
  - Enhances model performance by removing noise
  - Improves interpretability of EEG signals

# Slide 4: Neural Network Architecture
- Activation function: Sigmoid for output layer
  - Range [0, 1]: Ideal for probability outputs
  - Smooth and differentiable for gradient descent
  - Compatible with cross-entropy loss
- Limitation:
  - Vanishing gradient problem in deep layers
- Alternative: ReLU for hidden layers, Softmax for multi-class outputs

# Slide 5: Weight Initialization
- Method: Glorot (Xavier) Initialization
- Formula: W ~ U[-√(6/(n_in + n_out)), √(6/(n_in + n_out))]
- Benefits:
  - Balances variance of activations and gradients
  - Prevents exploding or vanishing gradients
- Designed for sigmoid/tanh activations

# Slide 6: Training Process
- Steps:
  - Forward pass: Compute predictions
  - Loss calculation: Cross-entropy
  - Backward pass: Compute gradients via backpropagation
  - Weight update: SGD (w = w - η * ∂L/∂w)
- Optimization:
  - Mini-batch gradient descent
  - Early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Early stopping logic:
  - Monitor validation loss
  - Stop if no improvement for 10 epochs

# Slide 7: Loss Function
- Choice: Cross-Entropy Loss
- Formula (binary): -[y log(p) + (1 - y) log(1 - p)]
- Why?
  - Ideal for classification tasks
  - Matches sigmoid output format
  - Penalizes confident wrong predictions
  - Provides strong gradients for optimization

# Slide 8: Model Evaluation
- Metric: Accuracy = (TR + TN + TS) / Total Samples
  - TR: True Relaxed
  - TN: True Neutral
  - TS: True Stressed
- Additional checks:
  - Class distribution analysis
  - Handle imbalance with oversampling/undersampling
- Visualization (Placeholder):
  - Training loss curve
  - Accuracy curve
  - Overfitting analysis

# Slide 9: Future Improvements
- Real-time EEG integration:
  - Embed pipeline with devices (e.g., Muse headband)
  - Enable doctors to monitor mental states live
- User-friendly model:
  - Accessible to non-experts
  - Potential for alternative risk detection
- Additional features:
  - Extract new EEG features for enhanced accuracy

# Slide 10: Conclusion
- Summary:
  - Effective EEG preprocessing with DCT and standardization
  - Neural network with sigmoid activation and cross-entropy loss
  - Robust training with Glorot initialization and early stopping
- Next steps:
  - Implement real-time EEG integration
  - Enhance model with additional features
  - Deploy for clinical and user-friendly applications
